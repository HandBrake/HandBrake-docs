AMD VCN
=======

## Supported Hardware and Configurations

- AMD Radeon RX5000 (RDNA) and RX6000* (RDNA2) series GPU or better
- Windows 10 or later
- Limited support is available on Ubuntu 20.04 and later.

Please note, these are not hard limits. Hardware encoding via VCN *might* work on older series GPUs and older operating systems, but this is not officially supported.
* RX 6400 and RX 6500 XT not supported due to lack of hardware encoder.

On Ubuntu Linux, [AMD Radeon Software for Linux version 22.40 or later](https://www.amd.com/en/support/linux-drivers) is required to use the VCN encoder. Install using the `amdgpu-pro-install` script according to AMD’s [installation guide](https://amdgpu-install.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Additionally, you must manually install the `amf-amdgpu-pro` package included in the download.

## Enabling support

Support for the AMD VCN encoder is enabled in preferences on the video tab. If your system is not supported, the option will be disabled.
<!-- /.system-windows -->

## Presets

The following presets are available under the 'Hardware' category in the presets menu:

- H.265 VCN 2160P 4K
- H.265 VCN 1080p

These are a good starting point for configuring HandBrake to use these encoders.


## Performance

HandBrake supports the AMD VCN hardware encoder but does NOT support the hardware decoder.

The CPU will still be used for:

- Video decoding 
- All video filters
- Audio encoding 
- HandBrake's engine, A/V sync etc
- Subtitles
- Muxing

These operations all happen in parallel as the job progresses. As such, it is normal to see high (or even 100%) CPU utilisation even when using VCN.

It is also common, particularly on lower-end or older hardware, for the CPU to be a bottleneck which will cause lower than expected performance. To minimize this effect, disable any filters that you do not require.

## Advanced options

The AMD VCN hardware encoder has a limited set of advanced encoder options. Generally speaking, it is not recommended to change these parameters, as the built-in presets offer a good range of options for common uses.

If using HandBrake’s graphical interface, you can set the options in the `Advanced Options` field on the `Video` tab in the following format:

    option1=value1:option2=value2
    
If using HandBrake’s command line interface, use the `--encopts` parameter as follows:

    --encopts="option1=value1:option2=value2"


### Option value types

The following value types are supported (each option only accepts one value type):

- integer  
  A number that can be written without a fractional or decimal component.

- boolean  
  0 means off (or disabled).  
  1 means on (or enabled).
 
- string  
  An alphanumeric string of characters. See the option’s comments for acceptable values.
