iPod 5G Support
=============================

![iPod 5G Checkbox](../../images/windows/ipod-5g-1.0.0.png "iPod 5G Checkbox")

Older classic iPods require a special atom to be written to the MP4 file before they will play back on the device or be transferable in iTunes.

HandBrake doesn't add this by default, but if you have an older classic iPod, you can turn it on by selecting the "iPod 5G Support" checkbox located under the Destination chooser.

This is only available for MP4 files.
